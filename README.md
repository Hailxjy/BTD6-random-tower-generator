# BTD 6 Randomizer

This project is a simple web application that generates random tower and crosspath combinations for the popular game Bloons TD 6. It provides an engaging way for players to challenge themselves and experiment with different strategies.

## Features

- Generates a random selection of towers from the game.
- Allows users to include or exclude heroes from the random selection.
- Configurable number of towers to be included in the generation.
- Adjustable maximum tier (between 3 and 5) for the randomly generated crosspaths.
- Option to generate "absolute" crosspaths, which forces the crosspaths to be the maximum tier instead of random number.
- Displays a neat table with the random selection of towers and their corresponding crosspaths.
